## Young Scientists’ Conference on Astronomy and Space Physics (Ukraine)
The premier international conference in Ukraine for bachelor, master, PhD students, and young postdocs. Unique to this conference is that its Local Organizing Committee (LOC) consists solely of students. My first engagement with this conference was in 2013 when I presented a poster. The following year, I joined the LOC, while in my first year of my Bachelor. By 2018, I had become the secretary of the conference, and by 2021, I was named the chairman of the "High-Energy Astrophysics" section.

## Ukrainian International Cosmic Ray Day 2022 
I organized the International Cosmic Ray Day for Ukrainian school students in collaboration with DESY. In total, we welcomed 16 students and had the support of 4 mentors. As the main organizer, my responsibilities included:

- Identifying and collaborating with other organizers, who assisted in adapting the DESY workshop on Cosmic Rays for this specific event.
- Recruiting students from Ukraine to participate in the event.
- Strategizing various contingency plans to ensure the event could proceed, given the potential challenges arising from the ongoing war in Ukraine

## Astronomy Battles Tournament by AstroSendbox
AstroSendbox is a nationwide Ukrainian astronomy competition designed for high school and undergraduate university students. You can learn more on the [official website] https://www.astrosandbox.com/fightsenglis). I liaise with sponsors from Germany and assist in organizing the event. Additionally, I'm a judge for the tournament.
